# Live-or-Death
Live or death, that is a question.

Human life is only once, and it is everyone's responsibility to cherish it, but there are times when to live or die, that is a question.
"Life is a one-time journey for each individual, and everyone should cherish it. However, there are moments when the question of 'live or death' becomes a real consideration."
